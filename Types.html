      <h2>Types of bricks</h2>
      <p>There are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials. </br> </br>
      Categorized by manufacture method:</br> </br>
      <b>Extruded</b> – made by being forced through an opening in a steel die, with a very consistent size and shape.</br> </br>
      <b>Wire-cut</b> – cut to size after extrusion with a tensioned wire which may leave drag marks</br> </br>
      <b>Moulded</b> – shaped in moulds rather than being extruded</br> </br>
      <b>Machine-moulded</b> - clay is forced into moulds using pressure</br> </br>
      <b>Handmade</b> - clay is forced into moulds by a person</br> </br>
      <b>Dry-pressed</b> - similar to soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix and is compressed with great force. </br> </br>
      Categorized by use:</br> </br>
      <b>Common or building</b> – A brick not intended to be visible, used for internal structure</br> </br>
      <b>Face</b> – A brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance</br> </br>
      <b>Hollow</b> – not solid, the holes are less than 25% of the brick volume.</br> </br>
      <b>Perforated</b> – holes greater than 25% of the brick volume.</br> </br>
      <b>Keyed</b> – indentations in at least one face and end to be used with rendering and plastering</br> </br>
      <b>Paving</b> – brick intended to be in ground contact as a walkway or roadway.</br> </br>
      <b>Thin</b> – brick with normal height and length but thin width to be used as a veneer</p>
